# Selenium Example

This project contains an example of a BDD test that runs against the github.com search.

It uses [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/) and [testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers) to interact
with the website.

_As we don't control github.com the test may break in the future, but it's a good example until we hit that point._
